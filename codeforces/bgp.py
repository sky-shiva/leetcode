# Bachgold problem is very easy to formulate. Given a positive integer n represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than 1.

# Recall that integer k is called prime if it is greater than 1 and has exactly two positive integer divisors — 1 and k.

# Input
# The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000).

# Output
# The first line of the output contains a single integer k — maximum possible number of primes in representation.

# The second line should contain k primes with their sum equal to n. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.
n = int(input())

if n % 2 == 0:
    print(n // 2)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        print(2, end=' ')
else:
    print(n // 2)
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1):
        print(2, end=' ')
    print(3, end=' ')
